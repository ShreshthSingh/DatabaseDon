# DatabaseDon
A SQL project for transitioning legacy point of sale dataset (csv) to a highly compatible mariadb database using just SQL. 


1. unzip legacy dataset
2. run ETL script
3. run views script
4. Run proc (stored procedure script)
5. Run trig(triggers script)
6. Do as many CRUD operations using any third party application on the database , still the datbase would be consistent as our scripts took care of that
7. If you want you can convert the relational database to noSQL JSON database by runnning sqltonosql script.
